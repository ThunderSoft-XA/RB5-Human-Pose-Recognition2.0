Hello everyone, now I will show you a model of human pose recognition based on RB5. This human pose recognition mode algorithm comes from the open source project openpose.
 Let me demonstrate this demo. First click on the APP, open the settings, and then add an RTSP Video streaming, click back, now the model has started to load, 
waiting for initialization, and now you can see that the human body pose has been recognized. The openpose algorithm recognizes 25 key points of the body. 
We show the human body by connecting the key points to form a skeleton of the human body.
